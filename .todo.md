Magic alternative:
    # METHOD_MATCHER = /^_(.*)/

    # def method_missing(name, *, **)
    #   if name =~ METHOD_MATCHER
    #     return render_partial($1, *, **)
    #   end

    #   super
    # end

    # def respond_to_missing?(method, include_all)
    #   METHOD_MATCHER.match?(method) || super
    # end
